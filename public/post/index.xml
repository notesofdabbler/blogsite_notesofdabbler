      <description>Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas are founders of fast.ai whose aim is to make deep learning accessible to all. They offer a course called Practical Deep Learning for Coders (Part 1). The last session, taught by Jeremy, was in Fall 2017 and the videos were released early January 2018. Their approach is top down by showing different applications first as black boxes followed by progressive peeling of the black box to teach the details of how things work.</description>

      <description>Since I have been hearing a lot about virtues of Blogdown in various forums, I thought I will also give it a shot. I am planning to do my future blog posts in blogdown. I used to have my older site in Wordpress. But I donâ€™t have plans at least in the near term to migrate the older content.
