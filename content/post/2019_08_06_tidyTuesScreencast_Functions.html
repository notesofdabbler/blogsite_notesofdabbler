<p>David Robinson has done several <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ">screencasts</a> where he analyzes a Tidy Tuesday dataset live. I have listened to a few of them and found them very interesting and instructive. As I donâ€™t use R on a daily basis, I have not kept up with what the latest is in Tidyverse. So when I listened to his screencasts, I learnt functions that I was not aware of. Since I sometimes forget which function I learnt, I wanted to extract all the functions used in the screencasts so that it is easier for me to refer to the ones that I am not aware of but should learn.</p>
<p>The approach I took is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get all the Rmd analysis files from the screencast github repo.</li>
<li>Extract the list of libraries and functions used in each .Rmd file</li>
<li>Plot frequencies of function use and review functions that I am not aware of</li>
</ul>
<p>The html file with all the code and results is in this <a href="http://notesofdabbler.github.io/blog_notesofdabbler/getCodeFuncs.html">location</a>. The R file used to generate the html file is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notesofdabbler/blog_notesofdabbler/master/popularTidyVerseFuncs/getCodeFuncs.R">here</a>.</p>
<p>The plot below shows the how many analyses used a particular package. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notesofdabbler/blog_notesofdabbler/master/popularTidyVerseFuncs/figure/libcntplt-1.png" width="800" /></p>
<p>The top library as tidyverse is to be expected. It is interesting that lubridate is second. I can see that broom is used quite a bit since after exploratory analysis in the screencast, David explores some models. There are several packages that I was not aware of but I will probably look up the following: widyr, fuzzyjoin, glue, janitor, patchwork and the context in which they were used in the screencast.</p>
<p>The plot below shows the number of functions used from each package. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notesofdabbler/blog_notesofdabbler/master/popularTidyVerseFuncs/figure/pkgcntplt-1.png" width="800" /></p>
<p>As expected, most used functions are from <em>ggplot2</em>, <em>dplyr</em>, <em>tidyr</em> since there is lot of exploratory analysis and visualization of data in the screencasts.</p>
<p>The next series of plots shows the individual functions used from the packages.</p>

<p>Based on the above figures, I am listing below some functions that I was not aware of and should learn</p>
<ul>
<li><em>count</em> function in <em>dplyr</em> as a easier way to count for each group or sum a variable for each group.</li>
<li><em>geom_col</em> function in <em>ggplot2</em> for bar graphs</li>
<li>I became aware of <em>forcats</em> package for working with factors. <em>fct_reorder</em> and <em>fct_lump</em> from the package were used frequently.</li>
<li><em>tidyr</em> functions - <em>nest/unnest</em>, <em>crossing</em>, <em>separate_rows</em></li>
<li>I realized that I know only a few functions in <em>stringr</em> and should learn more about several functions that were used in the screencast.</li>
</ul>
